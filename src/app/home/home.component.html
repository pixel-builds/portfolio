  <p class="text-1 just">
    I, am just a super curios guy. I am a student, so the maximum part of my day drains in study stuff and in the part left I try to enjoy or for making cool stuff. This website exists to share my ideas and the theories that interest me. I build custom software and services, but there's a lot more into it. <br><br> I will be sharing all kinds of logic, reasoning, and problems encountered during the process of engineering apps and services and other cool stuff, with a combination of innovation and storytelling.
